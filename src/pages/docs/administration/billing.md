## Billing dashboard

The Postman [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing) provides access to account management.

### Managing add-ons

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Add-ons** to view your team's additional features and their usage during your monthly billing period. These features include mock servers, monitoring, public documentation, the Postman API, custom domains, and integrations.

[![monitoring overages](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-add-ons-overages.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-add-ons-overages.jpg)

You can opt to allow or disable overages for mock server and monitor usage by selecting the icon to the right of each item. If enabled, you will be charged on a pay-as-you-go basis.

> If your API development pipeline is dependent on Postman monitoring, disabling overages may cause unintended consequences. To avoid this as well as potentially fluctuating pay-as-you-go charges, consider adding [pre-paid monitoring blocks](#purchasing-add-ons) to your team plan.

### Viewing account history

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Account History** to view your team's historical billing activity.

[![account history](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-account-history.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-account-history.jpg)

Items such as updates to your Postman subscription, card changes, payments, and charges are all listed in chronological order.  

### Viewing past invoices

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Invoices**. To get a copy of an invoice, hover over its listing and click **Get Invoice**.

[![invoices](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-get-invoice0.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-get-invoice0.jpg)

To add or edit the information on an invoice, see [adding custom information to invoices](#adding-custom-information-to-invoices).

## Payments

Postman offers various payment options dependent on your plan type.

### Managing cards

In order to add, remove, or set a default card, select **Payment Methods** in your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing).

To add, click **Add A New Card**.

To remove, hover over the card in question and select the trash can icon.

To set a card as default, hover over the card and **Set as Default**.

[![payment methods](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-payment-methods.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-payment-methods.jpg)

### Paying by invoice

Invoicing is available to Postman Business and Enterprise teams. New customers can [email the Postman Sales team](mailto:sales@postman.com) to get started. Existing customers can [submit a request](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/en-us) to be invoiced instead of automatically charged.

You can pay invoices online, via check, or via wire-transfer. Invoices will be sent to your team's billing email address found in your [billing details](http://go.postman.co/settings/team/billing-details), and will include offline payment instructions. Pending payments can be found in your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing).

### Adding custom information to invoices

To add or edit the information on an invoice, navigate to your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing) and select **Invoices** > **Edit Invoice Details** > **Billing Details**.

Add or update your billing email, company name, address, and (if applicable) VAT ID, then **Save Changes**. All future [invoices](https://go.postman.co/billing/invoices) will have the updated copy. To modify an existing invoice, [submit a request](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/en-us).

### Failed payments

If you have a card on file, Postman will automatically attempt 3 times to charge it. If this is unsuccessful, team members with billing privileges will be notified via email.

[![failed payment email](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/failed-payment-email.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/failed-payment-email.jpg)

If payment is unsuccessful, Postman offers a grace period of 10 days to avoid service disruption. For invoice-based teams, this means 10 days following the due date listed on the invoice.

> All team members are notified in the event of non-payment and subsequent service deactivation in Postman.

## Team and plan changes

You can change your team's plan and billing cycle in the [billing dashboard](https://app.postman.co/billing/overview).

### Changing your plan

To change your plan immediately, navigate to your [billing dashboard](https://app.postman.co/billing/overview) and click **...** > **Change Plan**. Choose **Monthly** or **Yearly** for your billing cycle, then select your preferred plan type. You can adjust your team size and **Proceed** to confirm changes.

[![change plan](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-modify-your-plan.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-modify-your-plan.jpg)

The cost of your new plan and/or additional seats will be prorated based on the time left in your team's billing cycle.

> To upgrade to Postman Enterprise, [contact Postman's sales team](mailto:sales@postman.com).

### Setting instructions for next billing cycle

You can set instructions to determine what will happen at the end of your current billing cycle. To do so, navigate to your [billing dashboard](https://app.postman.co/billing/overview), then click **...** > **Set instructions for next billing cycle**.

You can view your current plan and opt to **Edit Standing Instructions**. Select your preferred option from the drop-down, then click **Proceed** and confirm your changes.

<img alt="Set instructions for next cycle" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-set-instructions-for-next-billing-cycle.jpg" width="400px"/>

> You can change your standing instructions at any time before the end of your current billing cycle.

### Changing billing cycle

Monthly teams can switch to an annual plan at any time by navigating to your [billing dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview) and selecting **...** > **Change Plan**.

[![change plan](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-modify-your-plan.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-modify-your-plan.jpg)

> Annual teams can switch to a monthly plan at the end of the current billing cycle.Â The number of days left in your current billing cycle appears under **Upcoming Invoice**.

### Purchasing add-ons

The number of monitoring requests, custom domains, and mock server calls included in your plan depends on your [plan type](https://www.postman.com/pricing). You can enable or disable overages for monitoring and mock server calls by [managing your team's add-ons](#managing-add-ons). If enabled, you will be charged on a pay-as-you-go basis.

You can purchase additional blocks of monitoring requests, custom domains, and mock server calls by navigating to your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing) and selecting **Add-ons** > **Modify Add-ons**.
