### Where can I find logs for the Postman app?

**Note:** No request-level information is visible to us in the logs or via our internal systems. The only collection-related information that's logged is collection IDs and user IDs.

In the logs noted below, the file(s) _renderer-shared_ is where some details of synced data is referenced; you're welcome to audit it and redact anything you might not want to share.

#### In Postman's installation directory

Logs for the Postman app can be found in the following directories, depending on your operating system:

**MacOS**
`~/Library/Application Support/Postman/logs`

Instructions:

1. Copy the address above
2. Press **command** + **space** to open _Spotlight Search_
3. Paste the address you copied (**command** + **v**), and press return.

## Windows

`%AppData%\Postman\logs`

Instructions:

1. Copy the address above
2. Open the _Start Menu_ and search for _explorer.exe_, then press **return**.
3. Paste the address you copied (**control** + **v**), and press return

## Linux

`~/.config/Postman/logs`

Instructions:

## See documentation for your Linux distribution

### From within the Postman app

From the Postman app, you can access [DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/), or open the logs folder in Postman's installation directory.

#### DevTools

With the Postman app window open, click following in the menu bar to open _DevTools_ for the current app view, or shared:

* View → Developer → Show DevTools (Current View)​
* View → Developer → Show DevTools (Shared)​

See the following article for instructions on sharing DevTools logs with Postman Support:

* [How to share logs with Postman for debugging issue?](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025298633-How-to-share-logs-with-Postman-for-debugging-issue-)

##### Logs directory

With the Postman window open, click the following in the menu bar:

* View → Developer → View Logs in...

### What is Postman's security policy?

Security is a top concern at Postman, and we have taken a number of measures to ensure that your data stays secure. Our infrastructure is managed by Amazon Web Services and follows security-related best practices. Payments are handled solely by Stripe (a PCI Level 1 Service Provider).
Please view our complete security policy [here](https://www.getpostman.com/security).

### What usage data does Postman collect?

Postman does not track any content of your requests/responses.

We only track the number of requests made, number of headers sent etc to identify what features of the app are being used. Even this information is anonymous - any Postman user adding a header will cause the same tracking information to be sent.

You can disable all tracking by setting 'Send anonymous usage data to Postman' to No in the settings window.

### Will Postman use my collection data in any way?

No. As our [Privacy policy](https://www.getpostman.com/licenses/privacy) states, Postman will **not** sell, or rent, your collection/request/responses etc.

### I'm not able to access documentation via my configured custom domain

Postman Public Documentation published on a custom domain may not work due to the following reasons:

1. Domain verification not done.
2. Certificates from [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) not generated on your domain.

**1. Domain Verification** - Once a custom domain is added on your Postman account, it is important to complete the domain verification by creating the following DNS records:
**TXT record** - You need to configure on the root domain (eg: example.com)

**CNAME record** - need to be configured on the subdomain (eg: api.example.com or docs.example.com)

Please refer to the following [article](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/api_documentation/adding_and_verifying_custom_domains) for more information.

**2. Certificates from [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) not generated on your domain:**

Postman should have the authority to serve traffic on your domain. [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) lets us serve traffic by issuing us a certificate on your domain.

If your domain has CAA records set, you must explicitly allow LetsEncrypt to set certificates for your domain. Without this, certificates generated by LetsEncrypt won't be respected by browsers. To tackle this, follow this guide - [https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/) to add Letsencrypt to your CAA records.

### How do I recover my data?

## Summary of Issue

**One of the following may have brought you here**:

1. I opened the Postman native app and it looks empty - it looks like all my collections disappeared.
2. Data in the Postman native app, including Collections, environments, and globals, has been lost unexpectedly upon opening the app.

**Why is this happening?**

* This can happen because of the app's local database getting corrupted or when signing out of the app (which clears all local data).

## Resolution steps

## Check for synced data

If you were previously logged in to the app with your Postman account and had sync enabled, your data should be backed up to our servers. Signing out of the Postman app, and logging back in again, should restore your work.

To check what is synced to your Postman account, navigate to the link below.
[https://go.postman.co/me](https://go.postman.co/me)

**Attempt to recover local data**
If your work is not backed up to a Postman account, you can attempt to recover data from the app's local storage using the steps below.

**Please note:** this process will delete any local data for Postman Canary.

If you're using our Chrome app, please follow [the instructions in this article](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/en-us/articles/203837571-I-lost-all-my-data-when-I-opened-Postman) instead

1. Download and install [Postman Canary](https://www.postman.com/downloads/canary)
_If you already have Postman Canary installed, make sure to sign-out of the app and quit it before proceeding._

2. Make a copy of the folder: **file__0.indexeddb.leveldb** in your Postman directory, and paste it into the IndexedDB folder in your PostmanCanary.

## Windows

~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Copy**: %appdata%\Postman\IndexedDB​\file__0.indexeddb.leveldb
**Paste to**: %appdata%\PostmanCanary\IndexedDB​\

~~~~~~~~~~~~

## MacOS

~~~~~~~~~~~

**Copy**: ~/Library/Application Support/Postman/IndexedDB/file__0.indexeddb.leveldb
**Paste to**: ~/Library/Application Support/PostmanCanary/IndexedDB
~~~~~~~~~~~

## Linux

~~~~~~~~~~~

**Copy**: ~/.config/Postman/IndexedDB/file__0.indexeddb.leveldb
**Paste to**: ~/.config/PostmanCanary/IndexedDB/

~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open Postman Canary, and bulk export your data from within the app. Save the resulting .json file to your local machine. To learn more, please refer to [Data Dumps](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collections/data_formats/#data-dumps)

2. Open the stable Postman app (not Canary), and switch to a workspace where any recovered content will be added, and import the .json file you saved in step 3. To learn more, please refer to [Importing Data](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collections/data_formats/#importing-postman-data)

3. If any content is recovered, it will be added to your workspace after the import. If no data is recovered, you may only see a few empty default environments

If you need further assistance, please open a ticket with our Support Team: [https://www.postman.com/support] (https://www.postman.com/support)

### Postman Chrome app won't start

If you're using the Postman Chrome app:

1. We strongly suggest you move to the native apps ([https://www.getpostman.com/apps](https://www.getpostman.com/apps)) due to the deprecation of our official chrome extension for (OSX / Windows / Linux) and the native apps support a lot more features.
2. Before reinstalling, head to [chrome://indexeddb-internals/](chrome://indexeddb-internals/) and search for ""fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop"". There will be two folders listed - backup the contents of these folders.
3. Reinstall (navigate to this [link](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) and reinstall the latest version) and move the backup to its original location.

### Postman window is blank

## Issue

For Windows computers with certain GPUs, Postman may display a **blank/black window** when opened, and elements in the app may not be rendering correctly or at all.

![Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_4.36.22_PM.png](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/article_attachments/360040688194/Screen_Shot_2019-07-08_at_4.36.22_PM.png)

This issue may be related to a known issue where Postman doesn’t launch with certain GPUs. A workaround for this issue involves [disabling your GPU](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/4594#issuecomment-391601621). Disabling GPU rendering for Postman generally allows the app to run successfully. To do so, you'll need to add a Windows environment variable: `POSTMAN_DISABLE_GPU`, with the value: `true`

**Instructions:**

1\. Open:  `Advanced system settings`

[![step 1](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Troubleshootwindows6.1.png)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Troubleshootwindows6.1.png)

2\. Navigate to:  `Environment Variables`

[![step 2](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Troubleshootwindows6.12.png)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Troubleshootwindows6.12.png)

3\. Add a new system variable with the name: `POSTMAN_DISABLE_GPU`, and the value: `true`.

[![step 3](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Troubleshootwindows6.1+(1).png)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Troubleshootwindows6.1+(1).png)

4\. Click OK to save

If the issue persists and you see any error logs while the app launches, please send us those logs to investigate further at [help@getpostman.com](mailto:help@getpostman.com)

### Requests to my mock servers aren't returning the expected response

There are a few quick things you can check if your mock server isn't giving the intended response:

**Error1** (unable to find a matching request):

```
{
        "error": {
        "name": "mockRequestNotFoundError",
        "message": "We were unable to find any matching requests for this method type         <br>and the mock path, '/post', in your collection"
        }
}
```

There are two fields the system looks at while trying to find a matching response to return: the HTTP method and the request path

1. **Incorrect HTTP Method**: If the request in the saved example uses POST, you'll need to use POST while making requests to the mock server. The method needs to match with the saved example for the response to be returned.

2. **Incorrect Path URL**: The path is the segment of the URL after the host. For [http://api.service.com/users](http://api.service.com/users), "/users" is the path. While requesting saved response from a mock server, you'll need to send "/users" to the mock server too:

https://&lt;mock id&gt;.mock.pstmn.io/users

For more details on this, check our documentation at [https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/mock_servers/matching_algorithm](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/mock_servers/matching_algorithm)

**Error2:**

```
    {
        "error": {
        "name": "invalidCredentialsError",
        "message": "Please provide the required `x-api-key` authentication header."
        }
    }
```

The above error tells you that you mock is a private mock &amp; requires a Postman API key to be passed in the header.

### The variables for 'Get Access Token' are not synced

When the settings been created in the **"Get Access Token"** to have variables for "**Access Token URL**", "**Client ID**", and "**Client Secret**" to switch between environments then this works well without having to update the scripts. But when we sync or Export the Scripts and Environments then they don't default to the generic data entry.

![](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/article_attachments/360013550753/mceclip0.png)The reason being, the variables saved while generating auth token works fine only for the collections or requests on the app where the token was generated and it will not be synced as it may contain sensitive data.

So, If you try to access any collection/request which uses the same auth token on any other machine or app, it will not work since this is an expected behavior of the variables created for OAuth2.0.

### Why my published collection returns an error 403?

Your documentation may result in the below error 403 if the environment associated with the collection was created by a user who left the team.

![64537839-dd300400-d31b-11e9-8f4e-45a5156ba8cd.png](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/article_attachments/360049806254/64537839-dd300400-d31b-11e9-8f4e-45a5156ba8cd.png)

A quick way to verify that the error is caused by the unresolved environment is to **republish the collection without selecting any environment**.

To do so, head to your [Postman dashboard](http://app.getpostman.com/), select your collection and click on it. Then, click on ![Screen_Shot_2019-11-05_at_19.04.24.png](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/article_attachments/360050692893/Screen_Shot_2019-11-05_at_19.04.24.png)and select  _No Environment_  
![Screen_Shot_2019-11-05_at_19.06.29.png](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/article_attachments/360049809914/Screen_Shot_2019-11-05_at_19.06.29.png)

If your documentation is rendering fine without the Environment variable, let's go ahead and restore the environment. All you need to do is to **duplicate the environment**.

1\. Go to the Postman app and go to **Manage Environments**

![Screen_Shot_2019-11-05_at_18.54.31.png](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/article_attachments/360049808134/Screen_Shot_2019-11-05_at_18.54.31.png)

2\. In the **Manage Environments** window, hit ![Screen_Shot_2019-11-05_at_19.12.27.png](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/article_attachments/360050694313/Screen_Shot_2019-11-05_at_19.12.27.png) next to the environment you want to restore.  
3\. Edit the Published documentation.  
4\. Select the new, duplicated environment.  
5\. Republish the collection  

### How do I recover my data from the Postman Chrome app?

This can happen because of the local database getting corrupted.

If you had sync enabled, sign out, and sign back into the Postman app to recover your data. You can head to https://go.postman.co/me/collections to ensure all your data has been synced correctly.

If not, and you use the Chrome app, head to chrome://indexeddb-internals/ and search for "fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop". You should see two folders listed - you can create a zip file with the contents of those folders, and email them to help@postman.com. We should be able to recover your data.

We strongly recommend moving to our native apps (available from https://www.postman.com/apps) and signing in to avail Sync features.
